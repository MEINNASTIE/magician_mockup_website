# Lyney magic 1.0 mockup website

There is not much I can say about this one, but there is something that is worth mentioning:
- If you are interested in checking this curious little thing...
1. This website was made for experimenting with Framer Motion 
2. It has been cooked and served well with a Docker container (therefore it must be purged later)
3. There is a lot of room for improvement
4. Have fun!

Made with <3 for DCI and myself

## Important
For self: Cannot believe I was silly enough to delete all the node-modules (rookie mistake), but nevertheless most important to know:
- npm install
- react-dom
- tailwind
- next.js
- docker
- framer motion
